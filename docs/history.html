										<h2 class="title effectTitle">Creation, Demerger, and Journey Back to the Top (1970-78)</h2>
										<div class="partnership-box">
											<p class="effectText">The club we now know as Paris Saint-Germain was formed by sports executives Guy Crescent and Pierre-Étienne Guyot in an attempt to bring a major football team to France’s capital. To this end, they formed the Paris FC in 1969. To speed up the process of getting to Ligue 1, they merged their fledgling club with Stade Saint-Germain, a team that traces its roots to 1901 and had just earned the right to play in France’s second-tier Ligue 2. The club played their first friendly match on August 1, 1970. Four weeks later, Fédération Française de Football officially granted PSG the right to compete in Ligue 2. </p>
											<p class="effectText">The club had tremendous success from the get-go. The influx of money from the club’s new Parisian fanbase helped the coaching staff strengthen Saint-Germain’s existing talent pool. The most notable new signee was undoubtedly national team captain Jean Djorkaeff. PSG finished its first season 17-11-2 and claimed the Ligue 2 title after winning the championship play-offs. </p>
											<p class="effectText">The team had a solid debut in Ligue 1 during the 1971-1972 season and avoided relegation, however, due to financial trouble the club had to be split. Crescent and Guyot re-formed Paris FC and were allowed to remain in Ligue 1, while the club we now know as Paris Saint-Germain had to be re-established as a Division 3 amateur club.</p>
											<p class="effectText">Despite losing the majority of its star players to Paris FC and having to restart from scratch, the club earned a promotion to Ligue 2 during its first season. What was even more surprising was PSG’s performance next year in Ligue 2. After a victory in the promotion playoffs, PSG regained its place in Ligue 1, just two years after being reformed.</p>

										<h2 class="title effectTitle">Silver Age (1978-86)</h2>
										<div class="partnership-box">
											<p class="effectText">The club first established itself as a national powerhouse under president Francis Borelli, who was appointed in 1978. During the 1981–1982 season, following an exciting match that ended in a penalty shootout, Paris Saint-Germain claimed their first French Cup title. The following season, they repeated the same feat by beating Nantes 3 - 2. </p>
											<p class="effectText">Just three years later, during the 1985–1986 season, Paris Saint-Germain earned their first Ligue 1 title.</p>

										<h2 class="title effectTitle">Golden Age (1991-98)</h2>
										<div class="partnership-box">
											<p class="effectText">Following a lucrative ownership change, PSG became one of the richest squads in Ligue 1, increasing its annual budget by 33% for the 1991-1992 season. The very next year, PSG once again won the French Cup. In 1996, the club won the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup by defeating Austria’s Rapid Wien.  </p>
											<p class="effectText">PSG firmly cemented itself as a French powerhouse during the nineties. They won another Ligue 1 title, two French League Cups, two French Trophy of Champions victories, and four French Cups.</p>

										<h2 class="title effectTitle">Second Golden Age (2010-Now)</h2>
										<div class="partnership-box">
											<p class="effectText">The club’s performance in the years between 1998 and 2010 was a mixed bag. On the one hand, PSG won yet another French League Cup, three French Cups, as well as the prestigious UEFA Intertoto Cup. On the other hand, at the end of the decade, they found themselves battling to avoid relegation to Ligue 2.</p>
											<p class="effectText">The years of uncertainty ended when the club was purchased by QSI in 2011. The takeover made Paris Saint-Germain one of the richest football clubs in the world. The new ownership had a clear vision for the club. They wanted to transform it into an international football powerhouse and Champions League contender.</p>
											<p class="effectText">Just a year later, the club won the Ligue 1 title. The next season, they won three of the four major football titles in France. And things only got better the season after that. The squad became the first team in French football history to win all four national titles, those being the Ligue 1, French Cup, French League Cup, and the Trophy of Champions. The following year, they did it again. PSG would then go on to win three of those four titles during the 2016–17 season, with the Ligue 1 title slipping away from them for the first time in several years.</p>
											<p class="effectText">In 2017–18, PSG reclaimed their Ligue 1 title, as well as defending their French Cup, French League Cup, and the Trophy of Champions. In 2018-19, PSG once again won Ligue 1 and the Trophy of Champions. </p>
											<p class="effectText">This season, they were awarded both the Ligue 1 and the Champions Trophy. At the end of July, they won the French Cup and French League cup.</p>
